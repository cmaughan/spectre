## Host Types

| Host | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Neovim | `--host nvim` (default) | Embeds `nvim --embed` via msgpack-RPC over stdin/stdout pipes |
| Bash | `--host bash` | PTY-based terminal (Unix) |
| Zsh | `--host zsh` | PTY-based terminal (Unix) |
| PowerShell | `--host powershell` | ConPTY on Windows, PTY on macOS/Linux |
| WSL | `--host wsl` | Windows Subsystem for Linux shell |
| MegaCity | `--host megacity` | 3D demo host (semantic code city, textured road/sidewalk/tree materials, cascaded directional shadows, point-light cubemap shadows, screen-space AO, mouse-drag pan, Alt+drag orbit, local SQLite city snapshot cache, optional `--source` Tree-sitter scan-root override) |

Pane splits use the platform default shell (Zsh on macOS, PowerShell on Windows) regardless of primary host type.

## Rendering

- **Backends**: Vulkan (Windows), Metal (macOS)
- **Renderer target layout**: Public `draxul-renderer` API stays stable while the build internally splits shared renderer core and platform backend implementation targets
- **Architecture**: Two-pass instanced draw -- background quads then alpha-blended foreground glyphs
- **Glyph atlas**: Configurable size (default 2048x2048 RGBA8), shelf-packed, incremental upload
- **Buffer**: Host-visible/shared memory, direct writes, no staging. 112 bytes per cell
- **Frames in flight**: 2 with synchronization primitives
- **Pixel format**: BGRA8 Unorm (Neovim sends pre-sRGB colors)
- **MegaCity materials**: Textured asphalt road surfaces, paving-stone sidewalks, flat-color procedural n-gon building shell meshes with configurable roughness/metallic, bark-textured central-park trees, plus forward-lit material debug controls including metallic, tangent, bitangent, packed-TBN, directional-shadow, point-shadow, point-shadow-face, point-shadow-stored-depth, and point-shadow-depth-delta views
- **MegaCity surface pipeline**: Opaque MegaCity rendering now uses cascaded directional shadow maps, point-light cubemap shadow maps, a depth/normal AO prepass, an offscreen MSAA depth buffer, an MSAA `RGBA16F` scene color target, a resolved HDR scene texture, and a final `BGRA8 sRGB` scene texture before the main swapchain present; the debug panel can inspect the resolved HDR/final scene targets, directional shadow cascades, and point-shadow faces alongside the AO/GBuffer surfaces
- **MegaCity tone mapping controls**: The HDR post pass now applies tone mapping before the final sRGB target, with configurable `Exposure` and `White Point` controls in the Megacity lighting UI
- **MegaCity module surfaces**: Each non-central module now draws a thin module-colored outline above the shared road layer so module footprints are readable beneath sidewalks and buildings
- **MegaCity park dressing**: Central park now includes a procedurally generated `DraxulTree` mesh with atlas-based PBR leaf cards
- **MegaCity dependency routing**: The City Map panel now overlays routed building-to-building dependency lines driven by Tree-sitter field references and road-only semantic routing, and the same routed polylines are emitted into the 3D scene as thin raised connection strips with a directional green-to-red gradient from source to target, plus a configurable per-route layer step for stacked overlap readability
- **MegaCity semantic filters**: The City Build UI can now hide test entities and struct-backed entities before layout/build
- **MegaCity stacked struct plates**: Same-footprint structs within a module are stacked vertically into compact square-section plate buildings with configurable gap, max-per-stack, and sign colors; each plate remains independently clickable with full dependency routing and per-plate tooltips
- **MegaCity building shading controls**: The City Build UI includes `Middle Strip Push`, `Alternate Darken`, `Flat Roughness`, and `Flat Metallic` controls for non-textured procedural buildings, so flat-color shells can get configurable per-level mid-band ripples, alternating-band darkening, roughness, and metallic without affecting roads, routes, signs, or other flat overlays
- **MegaCity projection toggle**: The renderer panel can switch the MegaCity camera between `Orthographic` and `Perspective`; the choice persists in config, keeps the existing orbit/pan/zoom interactions, and also drives perspective-aware cascade splits and screen-space zoom scaling
- **MegaCity performance preview and coverage modes**: The Codebase Analysis panel now exposes saved top-level `Perf`, `Coverage`, `LCOV Coverage`, and `Perf Log Scale` controls. `Perf` blends flat-color buildings toward a green-to-red heat palette per semantic building layer using smoothed live timing heat, while `Coverage` forces any touched/matched function layer to full heat so executed code lights up clearly. `LCOV Coverage` imports a static LLVM `lcov` tracefile from `db/coverage.lcov` or `build/coverage.lcov` and lights semantic function layers based on function-level test coverage from the LLVM coverage report — covered functions render as hot, uncovered stay at base color. The local `do.py coverage` flow exports `build/coverage.lcov` and refreshes `db/coverage.lcov` for app use. The debug panel shows LCOV-specific diagnostics (report functions, covered functions, matched/heated layers/buildings), and the building tooltip reports per-function coverage status. `Perf Log Scale` applies a visual logarithmic boost to low heat values so more active layers move toward the warm end without changing the underlying timing data. All modes are driven by a live or imported metrics snapshot for every building and function, indexed in the shader by stable building/layer ids, and accompanied by an in-panel matched/unmatched perf debug readout plus tooltip timing details for hovered functions
- **MegaCity sign sizing controls**: Building roof-sign rings can now enforce a configurable `Min Width / Char`, so long class/module labels can expand the repeated sign band instead of being squeezed into the default building footprint
- **MegaCity building shape thresholds**: The City Build UI now exposes both `Hex Threshold` and `Oct Threshold`, letting connected buildings step from 4-sided to 6-sided to 8-sided procedural shells based on total incident dependency count
- **MegaCity selection tuning**: Selection fade now has configurable dependency, hidden, hover-hidden, and road hidden alpha controls, with configurable spacebar-held raise/fall timing for hidden buildings so the shared road layer can remain fully visible while selected-context buildings read clearly

## GUI (draxul-gui)

A standalone GUI library for rendering UI items that do not depend on ImGui. It leverages the project's font engine and GPU renderer for high-performance, pixel-precise overlays.

- **Tooltips**: Multi-line tooltips with a semi-transparent dark background and a 2-column table layout for labels and values. Rasterized on-demand via `TextService` and rendered as a screen-space alpha-blended quad.
- **Toast notifications**: Auto-dismissing notifications stacked at the bottom-right corner via `ToastHost` (info/warn/error levels with distinct colors and fade-out animation). Thread-safe `push()` and `IHostCallbacks::push_toast()` lets any host or app subsystem report recoverable failures (clipboard errors, font fallback warnings, unknown config keys, secondary host spawn failures, invalid pane targets) without blocking the user. Toasts pushed before the host exists during init are queued and replayed.
- **Shaders**: Generic `gui_tooltip.vert/frag` (Vulkan) and `gui.metal` (Metal) for rendering GUI elements.

---

## Font Pipeline

- **FreeType** loads faces, **HarfBuzz** shapes text, glyph cache rasterizes on demand
- **Ligatures**: Programming ligatures via HarfBuzz (configurable, default on)
- **Multi-weight**: Bold, italic, bold+italic via separate font files
- **Fallback chain**: Primary font + configurable fallback paths for missing glyphs
- **Emoji**: Color glyph rendering, variation selectors (VS-16), ZWJ sequences
- **Wide characters**: CJK double-width, combining characters
- **Bundled fonts**: JetBrains Mono Nerd Font (regular/bold/italic/bold-italic), Cascadia Code

---

## Terminal Emulation (shell hosts)

- **VT100+** escape sequence support (SGR colors, cursor control, DECSTBM scroll regions)
- **Scrollback**: 2000-row ring buffer with viewport offset
- **Alt screen**: Main/alt switching with snapshot restore
- **Mouse modes**: None, button-click, drag, all-motion (SGR encoding)
- **Bracketed paste**: VT-wrapped clipboard paste
- **Paste confirmation**: Pastes ≥ `paste_confirm_lines` newlines stash the payload and surface a toast; `confirm_paste` (default `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`) sends it, `cancel_paste` (default `Ctrl+Shift+Escape`) discards it. Set `paste_confirm_lines = 0` to disable
- **OSC 7**: Current working directory tracking from shell
- **OSC 52**: Clipboard read (`?` query) and write (base64 payload) for tmux/SSH/Neovim remote clipboard integration
- **Selection**: Click-and-drag with system clipboard integration; configurable cell cap (`selection_max_cells`, default 65536)
- **Word/line selection**: Double-click selects the word at the cursor (contiguous non-whitespace), triple-click selects the entire row
- **Copy on select**: Optional `copy_on_select` automatically copies completed mouse selections (drag, double-click, or triple-click) to the system clipboard
- **Keyboard copy mode**: `toggle_copy_mode` (default `Ctrl+Shift+Space`) enters a vim/tmux-style cursor: `h/j/k/l` and arrows move, `0/Home/End` jump to line bounds, `g/Shift+G` jump to top/bottom, `v`/`V` start char/line selection, `y` yanks to clipboard and exits, `Esc`/`q` exits without copy. Available on shell hosts only (Neovim panes already provide their own visual mode)
- **Terminal colors**: Configurable foreground/background via `[terminal]` config section

---

## Input

- **Keyboard**: Full SDL3 key events with modifier tracking (shift, ctrl, alt, super)
- **IME**: Text input + text editing event forwarding
- **Mouse**: Button, motion, wheel with per-host protocol routing
- **MegaCity camera**: Left-drag in the render view pans the scene, `Alt` + left-drag scrubs orbit
- **Smooth scroll**: Trackpad momentum accumulation (configurable speed multiplier)
- **File drop**: Native drag-and-drop dispatched to host as `open_file:` action
- **GUI keybindings**: Chord-style prefix bindings (e.g. `ctrl+s, |`)
- **Command palette**: `Ctrl+P` opens a centered fuzzy-search overlay for all GUI actions with fzf-style scoring, `Ctrl+J/K` navigation, and keybinding hints
- **Config reload**: `reload_config` rereads `config.toml` on demand so palette alpha, keybindings, scroll settings, ligatures, and font changes can be applied without a restart

---

## Split Panes

- Binary split tree with vertical and horizontal splits
- Draggable dividers with ratio-based sizing — hovering a divider switches the mouse cursor to the platform EW/NS resize cursor; click-and-drag updates the ratio in real time
- Per-pane host instance with independent lifecycle
- Focus tracking and pane-aware input routing
- Keyboard-driven pane focus navigation (`Ctrl+H/J/K/L` vim-style) via `focus_left`, `focus_right`, `focus_up`, `focus_down` actions
- Keyboard-driven pane resizing via `resize_pane_left`, `resize_pane_right`, `resize_pane_up`, `resize_pane_down` actions (each nudges the nearest enclosing divider by 5%)
- **Pane zoom**: `toggle_zoom` action (default `Ctrl+S, z`) expands the focused pane to fill the full window; toggling again restores the previous split layout exactly (like tmux `Ctrl+B z`)
- **Close pane**: Closes the focused pane and its host; if last pane, exits the app
- **Restart host**: Kills the current host in the focused pane and relaunches with the same arguments
- **Swap pane**: Swaps the focused pane with the next pane in spatial order

---

## Workspace Tabs

- Multiple workspaces, each with its own independent split tree and host set
- The top tab bar remains visible even with a single workspace and shows right-aligned pills for live system usage and active chord prefixes
- `new_tab` (`Ctrl+S, C`): Create a new workspace tab
- `close_tab` (`Ctrl+S, &`): Close the active workspace tab (disabled when only one tab remains)
- `next_tab` (`Ctrl+S, N`): Cycle to the next workspace
- `prev_tab` (`Ctrl+S, P`): Cycle to the previous workspace
- Tab switching preserves focus state per workspace (focus lost/gained notifications)

---
