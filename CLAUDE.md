# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

### Windows
Requires CMake 3.25+, Visual Studio 2022, and Vulkan SDK (with glslc).

```bash
cmake --preset default                              # Configure (Debug, VS 2022 x64)
cmake --preset release                               # Configure (Release)
cmake --build build --config Release --target draxul # Build
```

Run: `.\build\Release\draxul.exe` (requires `nvim` on PATH). Pass `--console` to allocate a debug console window.

### macOS
Requires CMake 3.25+, Xcode Command Line Tools (for Metal compiler).

```bash
cmake --preset mac-debug                             # Configure (Debug)
cmake --preset mac-release                           # Configure (Release)
cmake --preset mac-asan                              # Configure (Debug + AddressSanitizer/LSan)
cmake --build build --target draxul                 # Build
cmake --build build --target draxul-tests           # Build unit tests (with ASan preset: sanitizers enabled)
```

Run: `./build/draxul.app/Contents/MacOS/draxul` or `open ./build/draxul.app` (requires `nvim` on PATH).

To run the unit test suite under ASan: `cmake --preset mac-asan && cmake --build build --target draxul-tests && ctest --test-dir build -R draxul-tests`.

### Debugging / Logging

Use the `--log-file` and `--log-level` CLI flags for debug logging. These are reliable on all platforms (env vars like `DRAXUL_LOG_FILE` do not propagate into macOS `.app` bundles).

```bash
./build/draxul.app/Contents/MacOS/draxul --host zsh --log-file /tmp/debug.log --log-level debug
```

- `--log-level <level>` — set minimum log level: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`. Defaults to `debug` when `--log-file` is given without `--log-level`. Logs always go to stderr (the launching terminal), so `--log-level debug` alone is enough for console debugging.
- `--log-file <path>` — additionally write logs to a file (useful when stderr is not visible).
- Use `DRAXUL_LOG_DEBUG(LogCategory::App, "fmt", ...)` for temporary instrumentation; these compile to real calls (not stripped) so they appear whenever the level is set to `debug` or lower.
- Env vars (`DRAXUL_LOG`, `DRAXUL_LOG_FILE`, `DRAXUL_LOG_CATEGORIES`) still work when launching the binary directly (not via `open`), but prefer the CLI flags.

## Architecture

Draxul is a Neovim GUI frontend. It spawns `nvim --embed`, communicates via msgpack-RPC over stdin/stdout pipes, and renders the terminal grid using the platform's GPU API (Vulkan on Windows, Metal on macOS).

### Dependency Graph (libraries only link downward)

```
                    draxul-types (header-only)
                   /      |       |       \
          window   renderer   font    grid
            |         |        |       |
            └────┬────┘        └───┬───┘
                 |                 |
              draxul-nvim --------┘
                 |
        draxul-app-support
                 |
                app (executable)
```

### Data flow

```
nvim --embed (child process)
  → [msgpack-RPC over pipes, reader thread]
  → NvimRpc notification queue
  → App::run() drains queue each frame
  → UiEventHandler parses ext_linegrid "redraw" events → Grid (2D cell array with dirty tracking)
  → App::update_grid_to_renderer() resolves highlights, shapes text, rasterizes glyphs
  → Renderer buffer write (GpuCell array, 112 bytes/cell)
  → Two-pass instanced draw: background quads, then alpha-blended foreground glyphs
```

### Key abstractions

- **Renderer hierarchy** (`libs/draxul-renderer/include/draxul/`): `IBaseRenderer` → `I3DRenderer` → `IGridRenderer`. The grid renderer IS-A 3D renderer IS-A base renderer. `MetalRenderer` and `VkRenderer` implement `IGridRenderer` and transitively satisfy both upper tiers.
  - `IRenderPass` / `IRenderContext` (`base_renderer.h`): typed render pass abstraction replacing the legacy `void*` callback. Any subsystem can register a pass with `I3DRenderer::register_render_pass(shared_ptr<IRenderPass>)`; the renderer calls `IRenderPass::record(IRenderContext&)` each frame.
- **Host hierarchy** (`libs/draxul-host/include/draxul/host.h`): `IHost` → `I3DHost` → `IGridHost` → `GridHostBase`. Terminal/Neovim hosts inherit `GridHostBase` (which provides no-op 3D hooks). `MegaCityHost` inherits `I3DHost` directly and registers a `CubeRenderPass` via `attach_3d_renderer()`.
  - `HostManager` calls `attach_3d_renderer()` post-`initialize()` for any host that is `I3DHost` (one-shot `dynamic_cast` at startup only).
- **IWindow** (`libs/draxul-window/include/draxul/window.h`) — abstract window interface. The renderer knows nothing about fonts, neovim, or text — only colored rectangles and textured quads at grid positions.
- **App** (`app/app.h/cpp`) is the orchestrator that owns all subsystems and runs the main loop.
- Platform-specific renderer implementations live in `libs/draxul-renderer/src/vulkan/` (Windows) and `libs/draxul-renderer/src/metal/` (macOS).

### Rendering

- Buffer indexed by instance index — no vertex buffers, quads generated procedurally in vertex shaders
- Two passes per frame: BG (opaque colored quads) then FG (alpha-blended glyph quads from atlas)
- Host-visible/shared buffer — direct writes, no staging (grid is small)
- Glyph atlas: 2048x2048 RGBA8 texture (4 bytes/pixel), shelf-packed, incremental upload
- 2 frames in flight with synchronization primitives
- Pixel format: BGRA8 Unorm (not SRGB — neovim sends colors already in sRGB)

#### Vulkan-specific (Windows)
- SSBO with host-visible coherent memory via VMA
- Descriptor sets, render passes, swapchain management via vk-bootstrap
- Shaders: GLSL 4.50 compiled to SPIR-V via glslc

#### Metal-specific (macOS)
- MTLBuffer with shared storage mode (CPU+GPU visible)
- CAMetalLayer for drawable management
- Shaders: Metal Shading Language compiled to .metallib via xcrun

### Threading

- **Main thread**: SDL events, nvim message processing, grid mutation, GPU rendering
- **Reader thread**: blocking reads from nvim stdout, MPack decode, push to thread-safe queue

All grid and GPU state is only touched by the main thread.

### Neovim RPC

- MPack library with `MPACK_EXTENSIONS=1` (required for neovim's ext types: Buffer/Window/Tabpage)
- Handles `grid_line` run-length encoding, double-width chars, multi-byte UTF-8
- Only renders on `flush` events

### Font pipeline

- FreeType loads face → HarfBuzz shapes codepoints to glyph IDs → GlyphCache rasterizes on-demand with shelf-packing → atlas uploaded to renderer

## Dependencies

All fetched automatically via CMake FetchContent (in `cmake/FetchDependencies.cmake`): SDL3, FreeType, HarfBuzz, MPack. On Windows: vk-bootstrap, VMA. Shaders compiled from GLSL to SPIR-V via glslc (Windows, `cmake/CompileShaders.cmake`) or from Metal to metallib via xcrun (macOS, `cmake/CompileShaders_Metal.cmake`).

- **GLM** is the preferred library for vector and matrix types (`glm::vec2`, `glm::vec3`, `glm::vec4`, `glm::mat4`, etc.). Use GLM rather than custom structs or other math libraries.

## Config Notes

- User settings live in `config.toml`.
- `enable_ligatures = true/false` controls whether Draxul combines eligible two-cell programming ligatures during shaping; it defaults to `true`.
- `smooth_scroll = true/false` enables trackpad momentum-style scroll accumulation; defaults to `true`.
- `scroll_speed = 1.0` is a multiplier applied to the raw scroll delta before accumulation in the smooth-scroll path. Range: (0.1, 10.0]; values outside this range log a WARN and fall back to `1.0`. Values below `1.0` slow scrolling; values above `1.0` speed it up.
- `enable_toast_notifications = true/false` toggles the corner toast overlay; defaults to `true`. When `false`, all `push_toast` calls are dropped (warnings still log).
- `toast_duration_s = 4.0` controls how long each toast stays visible before fading. Range: 0.5--60.0; out-of-range values are clamped.
- GUI-only shortcuts are configured under a `[keybindings]` table with action names such as `toggle_diagnostics`, `copy`, `paste`, `font_increase`, `font_decrease`, and `font_reset`.
- Keep GUI keybinding changes in the Draxul layer only; Neovim key remapping still belongs in Neovim config.

## Validation Expectations

- **Always build and run the smoke test before committing.** Use `cmake --build build --target draxul draxul-tests` followed by `py do.py smoke` (or `python do.py smoke` on Windows). This catches broken includes, link errors, and basic startup failures that only surface after merging changes from multiple sources.
- If you touch RPC, redraw handling, or input translation, run `ctest`.
- If you touch renderer code, build the platform-specific app target and verify startup at least once.
- After implementing a user-facing feature or rendering-affecting change, run the render smoke/snapshot suite with `t.bat` or `ctest` and confirm the relevant `draxul-render-*` scenario still passes.
- When blessing render references, use `py do.py blessbasic`, `py do.py blesscmdline`, `py do.py blessunicode`, `py do.py blessnanovg`, or `py do.py blessall` from the repo root instead of calling `draxul.exe --render-test` manually.
- If you change build wiring, keep both Windows and macOS paths valid in CI.
- Do not run `clang-format` manually in this repo. The pre-commit hook runs `clang-format` automatically on staged files, so if formatting is needed the first commit attempt may fail; re-stage the hook's edits and retry the commit.
- When you complete a work item or a concrete subtask from `plans/work-items/*.md`, update that markdown file in the same turn and mark the completed entries with Markdown task ticks (`- [x]`). Leave incomplete follow-ups as unchecked items so progress stays visible in the file itself.
- When a work item from `plans/work-items/*.md` is fully complete, move it to `plans/work-items-complete/` in the same turn and update any index/reference links that still point at the old location.
- After implementing a new user-facing feature, configuration option, CLI flag, or build/CI change, update `docs/features.md` to include it. This file is the canonical reference for what the app already supports — keeping it current prevents future agents from proposing work items for features that already exist.
- Before creating new work items, check `docs/features.md` to verify the proposed feature or capability is not already implemented.

## Platform

- **Windows**: MSVC/Visual Studio 2022. Process spawning uses `CreateProcess` with piped stdin/stdout. Built as a Windows GUI app (`WIN32_EXECUTABLE`).
- **macOS**: Clang/Xcode. Process spawning uses `fork()`/`exec()` with `pipe()`. Rendering via Metal.

## Known Pitfalls

- Do not include backend-private renderer headers from `app/`.
- Keep shutdown paths non-blocking; a stuck Neovim child must not hang the UI on exit.
- Font-size changes must relayout existing grid geometry even before Neovim acknowledges a resize.
- Unicode rendering is still cell-oriented. Be careful when changing shaping or grid-line parsing because combining clusters and wide glyphs are easy to regress.
- Never duplicate a header between `src/` and `include/draxul/`. Each header lives in exactly one place: public API headers under `include/draxul/` (included with angle brackets), internal headers under `src/` (included with quotes). Maintaining two copies causes them to diverge silently and is flagged by static analysis (SonarCloud).

## Replay Fixtures

Use `tests/support/replay_fixture.h` for redraw-oriented tests. It provides small builders for:

- msgpack-like arrays and maps
- `grid_line` cell batches
- full `redraw` event vectors

This is the preferred way to reproduce UI parsing bugs without launching Neovim.

## Review Consensus

When the user asks to "come to consensus" on reviews, do not just concatenate or summarize review files.

Treat it as a synthesis task:

- read the review notes from the relevant agent folders under `plans/reviews/`
- identify where the agents agree, where one review adds useful detail, and where there is real disagreement or just a sequencing difference
- reconcile the review notes against the current tree so already-fixed or stale issues are called out instead of repeated blindly
- produce a planning-oriented consensus note with suggested fix order, not just a findings list
- where helpful, explicitly attribute points to the agent models that raised them

The result should read like a conversation and planning review for fixes, with a current recommended path forward.

## Consensus Shortcut

When the user says `come to consensus`, treat that as a direct instruction to execute the saved consensus prompt in `plans/prompts/consensus_review.md`.

## Prompt History

When the user asks to store prompts from the current thread, write them to a dated markdown file under `plans/prompts/history/` in chronological order and mark interrupted or partial prompts inline.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming -> invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors -> invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR -> invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs -> invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff -> invoke review
- Update docs after shipping -> invoke document-release
- Weekly retro -> invoke retro
- Design system, brand -> invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish -> invoke design-review
- Architecture review -> invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume -> invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check -> invoke health
